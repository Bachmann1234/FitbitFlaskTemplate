#Fitbit OAuth Flask Template

## To those watching closely... I have not added the fitbit part yet...

This project defines a basic structure to make applications based
on the Fitbit API.

It defines an app structure that will give you a database, a login form, and 
a very basic registration form.

The Flask Structure is from [Miguel Grinberg's Book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031116.do) 

If you wish to learn more about Flask check it out. Or the [Flask Project Page](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
